The task involved creating a Finance Dashboard that offers a comprehensive overview of the revenue and expense structure of the organization. By gathering valuable insights and metrics, I was able to develop Power BI dashboards for the Sales, Finance, and Inventory teams. These dashboards provide detailed information and analytics, enabling the respective teams to make informed decisions and effectively manage their areas of responsibility.

To create this dashboard I have undertaken date and text transformations, modelled the data as per business requirement, made use of DAX formulas for efficient and complex calculations.Further on, I have made use of various types of visualizations namely Gauge, KPI, Card,Scatter chart, clustered bar chart,Maps and Decompostion tree. which has been very useful to gain effective analysis.

The Following are the KPI's that are covered in this project.

1.Sum Of Forcast VS Sum Of Budget
2.Actuals VS Budget
3.Budget Forecast VS Budget Forecast % by date.
4.Budget VS Forecast % by cost element group
5.Budget VS Forecast % by region
6.Budget VS Forecast % Department wise
7.Budget VS Forecast is created in Decompostion tree which is used to identify what factor is effecting the cost element group.
